# Machine Learning Applied to Wind and Waves Modelling
In this repository it is shared the code of the bachelor's degree final project in Software Engineering:

**Machine Learning applied to Wind and Waves Modelling**

The repository is structured in three folders:
- **EDA and Data cleaning** contains .m files needed during the developing of **Exploratory Data Analysis and Data cleaning phases**. Here is included the code for:
    - Data loading from the web page of NOAA
    - Variables analysis and plots visualization, 
    - Correlation analysis implementation and 
    - Data cleaning; which include missing values detection and deletion as well as outliers deletion.

- **Features selection and extraction** contains the calculation of F-test score for measure the significance of the variables as well as .m files for data combination that let us   obtain the data sets used during the Training phase.

- **Evaluation**
