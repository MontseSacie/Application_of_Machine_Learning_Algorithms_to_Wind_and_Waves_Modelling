function [DMeanp] = nearestNeighboursDistance(points,idxKneighbours,k)
%this function calculate for each point in "points", the mean
%distance from the point to each of its kneighbours (look kneighbours in "points" 
%by idxkNeighbours)
%INPUTS
    %points : data points
    %idxKneighbours: matrix with indexes of k nearest neighbours to each
                    %point in points
    %k = number of nearest neighbour considered
%OUTPUTS
    %DMeanp = nearest Neighbours mean distance for each point of points
